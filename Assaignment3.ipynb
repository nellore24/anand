{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"Ans. No need to write a duplicate code.So program would be shoter. Easy to          update many values in function call and easy to read a code."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's          called?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"Ans.The code in a function excutes when function is called. not when the           function is specified."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"3.

What is the difference between a function and a function call?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"Ans. A function is name which placed after def statement.So we need def              statement to define a function name.\n  \n    Function call means a function name in which we pass some values. So values     gonna evalueates as per logic in def block of code and it return results.\n   "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program?

What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value    in an expression?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"Ans.
